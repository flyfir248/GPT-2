The Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) is a machine learning model that has been trained on a massive amount of text data. It uses this training data to generate new text that is similar to the text it was trained on.

To use GPT in python, you will need to install the PyTorch library. This can be done by following the instructions on the PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Once PyTorch is installed, you can use the GPT2Tokenizer and GPT2LMHeadModel classes from the transformers library to access the pre-trained GPT model.

To use the GPT2Tokenizer, you will first need to import it from the transformers library. You can then initialize the tokenizer with the GPT2 pre-trained model. Once the tokenizer is initialized, you can use it to tokenize text and convert it into a format that can be fed into the GPT2LMHeadModel.

To use the GPT2LMHeadModel, you will first need to import it from the transformers library. You can then initialize the model with the GPT2 pre-trained weights. Once the model is initialized, you can use it to generate text by passing in a prompt and specifying the number of tokens to generate.

Please note that you may need to restart your runtime after installation.

It is also important to note that if you encounter an "Unresolved GPT2Tokenizer" error, it is due to the absence of the transformers library, it can be installed via pip install transformers

Please also check the versions of the library you are using and make sure they are compatible with the version of the Pytorch library you have installed.

##### The output I got upon running python main.py: 
**upon a time the entire region was under threat. In the winter of 1855, the Emperor of Russia, Alexander I, ordered his army to retreat to the mountains to fight against the Germans. The German armies had been unable to hold their own in the spring of 1856, when the Emperor of Russia was taken prisoner and died in the camp at the beginning of the war. During his captivity, Alexander I was executed and, in the following year, was found guilty of treason, having been**
